Question 1: Multiplies numbers together, increasing the multiplying number by 1 until a pre-defined threshold is reached, at which point the multiplying number responsible and the result is printed and the program stopped.

Question 2: The function lay_out_string_structure takes in a list (or tuples or sets) and puts them in the dictionary as keys, with the values containing another dictionary which stores information about the length of the string and its parity based on its length

Question 3: This script takes pre-defined pairs of integers stored in a 2D list, discards pairs which contain a negative number and stores and prints the results

Question 4: This script creates a list of random numbers between 0 and 1, sorts this list in ascending order, generates another random number and finds all the numbers in the list which is greater than or equal to the standalone random number generated. It then will store their indices in a list and print the first matching index

Question 5: The function circle_area_coverage takes the radii of two circles, calculates their areas, figures out which circle is bigger and returns the percentage the smaller circle can fill up when inside the bigger circle

Question 6. The function distribution_analysis takes a list of numbers, puts them into a new list to sort them, and finds the percentage of numbers in the original list that are less than or equal to each unique number. It stores this data in a dictionary and returns it.

Question 7: The function convert_seconds_to_time_since_midnight takes in the number of seconds since midnight and finds the current time by converting those seconds into hours, minutes and seconds

Question 8: This script utilises the library pandas to create a new field which is a result of the previous 3 fields added together
